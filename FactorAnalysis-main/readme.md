UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING: Factor Analysis and PCA

> When to apply the factor analysis?


• When the variables are metrics: it depends on the correlations between
variables

• This is the grouping of the variables into factors. 

Objectives:

• Obtain the behavior of the set of variables, combining them for structural reduction

• Analysis of the validity of constructs by identifying the variables allocated to factors

• Elaboration of rankings for the classification of performance through factors

• Creation of orthogonal factors among them and subsequent to the use in supervised
models
