Unsupervised Machine Learning with Clustering (Grouping observations) in **R**
> **Exploratory technique**
> The objective is to group the observations in homogeneous and heterogeneous
groups


• **Inside the group:** similar observations based on the variables used in the analysis

• **Among different groups:** different observations based on the variables used in the analysis
> [!NOTE]
> Hierarchical Clustering method
• The amount of clusters is defined throughout the analysis (step by step)
> Non-Hierarchical K-means Method
• The quantity of cluster that will be formed is defined a priori.
