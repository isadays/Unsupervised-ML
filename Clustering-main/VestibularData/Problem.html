<h1>A professor very concerned about the students' learning capacity wants to allocate them into groups with the greatest possible homogeneity,
based on the grades obtained in the entrance exam in subjects considered quantitative (Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry). 
In this sense, the teacher carried out a survey of these grades, which range from O to 10, and,
given that he will initially carry out a group analysis in an algebraic manner, he decided to work, for teaching purposes, with only five students. 
The database is found in Table 9.11. </h1>
