> UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING: Simple and Multiple Correspondence Analysis
>
>• When to apply the correspondence analysis?
> 
>• Adequate technique for the analysis of categorical variables (qualitative)
> 
>• The objective is to verify if there is a statistically significant association between the
variables and their categories, creating the perceptual map to visualize the
associations
> 
>• If there is a quantitative variable, it is necessary for it goes through a categorization
process previously
>
> • For example: the age is a quantitative variable (25, 42, 73, 81 years) and could be categorized as: 0-
30 years is the category 1, 31-60 years is the category 2, 61-90 years is the category 3...

>• It is an exploratory technique (not supervised)
>
> • To evaluate the joint relationship between the variables
>
> • There are no models of the type “yi = x1i + x2i + ... + ui”
>
> • They are not suitable for inference purposes
>
> • If new observations are added to the database, it is appropriate to do the analysis
again
